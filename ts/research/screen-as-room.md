## Introduction

Spatial metaphors have long shaped interface design, from the 1984 Macintosh through Xerox PARC's pioneering work. This essay explores interfaces not merely as spaces, but as metaphorical rooms -- examining how subjective, experiential qualities of architecture can inform digital design.

## Core Thesis

Rather than focusing on spatial dimensionality (the traditional "space as model" approach), Locher advocates for "space as metaphor" -- considering how rooms are *experienced* and what they *feel* like, emphasizing their artificial, human-made character.

## Seven Qualities of Well-Designed Rooms

### 1. Sense of Agency
Le Corbusier's "Architectural Promenade" concept applies to interfaces: users need freedom to choose their own path while designers ensure all possible routes have been thoughtfully considered. Great interfaces offer many affordances simultaneously without allowing users to reach unintended error states.

### 2. Sense of Proportion
Visual design can create vastly different spatial impressions regardless of actual size. Designers should think of user flows as floor plans, deliberately varying screen experiences rather than relying on uniform templates.

### 3. Sense of Protection
Walls serve dual purposes -- enclosing what's inside while excluding external threats. Digital boundaries similarly need complexity: permeable enough for necessary interchange, but solid enough for protection. "Rhetoric boundaries" can suggest division while remaining accessible.

### 4. Room as Base for Customization
Most buildings adapt to occupants' needs over decades. Digital interfaces rarely offer equivalent flexibility. Early Windows Phone exemplified user-centered design by enabling personality expression within rigid structure. Programmability and adaptive reuse represent digital equivalents to architectural customization.

### 5. Room as Shared Space
Multiplayer applications require understanding proxemics -- how spatial relationships express intent. Features like cursor visibility in Figma communicate presence and intention. Rooms become media for asynchronous communication when designed with dedicated interaction spaces.

### 6. Room as Shaper of Behavior
Implicit constraints derived from context prove more powerful than explicit rules. Rooms communicate expected behaviors through social norms embedded in their design. Digital interfaces can similarly guide appropriate actions through context rather than prohibition.

### 7. Room as Purposefully Articulated Space
Architects must decide which problems to solve, accepting that comprehensiveness produces mediocrity. Highly focused designs like Things (by Cultured Code) achieve excellence through selective problem-solving, mirroring Mies van der Rohe's approach. However, forced simplicity creates blandness; complexity sometimes demands nuanced solutions.

## Limitations of the Metaphor

The room metaphor inadequately captures interfaces' dynamic, fleeting qualities and their tool-like character. It remains one among many useful frameworks rather than a complete model.

## Key Insight

As interfaces increasingly become shared spaces, understanding them architecturally becomes essential. Two-dimensional screens can function as places with equivalent design rigor to virtual reality environments.
