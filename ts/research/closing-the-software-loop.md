# Closing the Software Loop

**Author:** Benedict Brady
**Date:** January 25, 2026

## Introduction

Brady references Andrej Karpathy's observation that Tesla's autopilot team could take vacation "and the cars would not only survive but get better at driving." He explores applying this principle to chat-based software applications like Meridian, an investment tracking platform.

## The Traditional Product Development Loop

The conventional software development cycle relies on user observations to identify improvement opportunities. Product teams document these as feature requests or bug reports, engineers propose solutions, and teams review code before deployment. Brady notes this cycle typically spans "anywhere from an afternoon to a few weeks depending on the size of the request."

He illustrates with scheduled trading: users want to purchase Bitcoin weekly at specific price points, requiring specification, implementation, and iterative refinement.

## Acceleration Through Coding Agents

Coding agents now optimize the implementation phase. Brady states "Features that would take a week to implement can be solved overnight" through AI assistance, compressing timelines to hours or days. This requires teams to maintain rigorous backlogs and clear business documentation to keep agents focused.

## Building Infrastructure

Brady emphasizes agents need comprehensive tooling: log inspection, dev environment deployment, browser/simulator access, and documentation. He acknowledges current limitations with "browser and computer use" but expects rapid improvement.

## Automating Feature Discovery

Three data sources can feed autonomous feature generation:

1. Legacy system telemetry identifying bugs
2. Chat product requests from users
3. Agent-conducted user interviews

## Closed-Loop Development Vision

Future systems maintain human oversight for strategic decisions. Rather than reviewing pull requests, humans define system values and arbitrate between competing approaches -- akin to a "Claude Soul Document" for products. Agents increasingly ask clarifying questions and propose multiple implementations based on feedback.

## Conclusion

Brady envisions waking to notifications about agent-identified features like "scheduled trading actions" that improve products autonomously, achieving seamless continuous development.
