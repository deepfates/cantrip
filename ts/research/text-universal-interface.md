The piece opens with Douglas McIlroy's foundational Unix philosophy quote about programs handling text streams as a universal interface. It traces how this principle emerged in the late 1960s through pioneers like McIlroy and Ken Thompson, whose composable tools -- grep, diff, and others -- demonstrated the power of modular software that operates on standardized text formats.

The author then pivots to modern AI, discussing how large language models represent a contemporary realization of these Unix principles. GPT-2's 2019 release initiated what researchers call the "age of large language models," marking a shift where data scale became more important than dataset curation in deep learning.

The article explores how LLMs exhibit emergent capabilities across diverse tasks -- from chess to robotics -- because most human knowledge can be represented as text. This observation has sparked "prompt engineering," a new discipline where developers craft text inputs to guide AI behavior without retraining custom models.

Using mem.ai as an example, the author illustrates how companies leverage APIs like GPT-3 rather than building proprietary models. Prompt engineers iteratively refine text instructions, treating each prompt as instantiating "a different conditional probability distribution" or "mood" in the model.

The piece emphasizes that this approach mirrors Unix pipes: outputs from one prompted query become inputs for another, enabling modular cognitive workflows. Test sets help engineers validate prompt changes before deployment, reducing costs by optimizing token usage.

Looking forward, the author suggests language models increasingly serve as universal computing interfaces, extending beyond text to images (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) and graphical interfaces (Adept.AI's work on converting text commands to GUI actions).

The conclusion presents a vision where business processes, engineering problems, and creative tasks become text I/O streams, with language models functioning as "bicycles for the mind" -- leveraging their generalized intelligence to solve previously bespoke challenges through prompt composition rather than traditional programming.
