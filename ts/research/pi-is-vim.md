# pi is vim

## Content

The author explores the parallels between vim as a text editor and pi as a coding agent platform. They discuss how switching to vim a decade ago--inspired by Drew Neil's advocacy for "editing text at the speed of thought"--fundamentally changed their development approach.

The piece contrasts traditional IDEs, which come "confronted with a wild excess of features" and "designed-by-committee aesthetics and bloat," with vim's philosophy of starting minimal and customizing incrementally.

The author describes how their daily use reveals friction points, and addressing these iteratively creates a personalized environment rather than accepting generic solutions. They found pi embodies this same principle for AI coding agents. Rather than abandoning pi for newer tools, they port valuable features back into their pi setup, maintaining "deliberate stability" while preserving flexibility for experimentation through extensibility.

The central thesis: pi functions as a customizable foundation where developers craft their ideal agent environment through iterative refinement, mirroring vim's evolutionary approach to tool development.
