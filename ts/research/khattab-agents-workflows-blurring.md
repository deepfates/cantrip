# Agents vs Workflows: The Blurring Distinction

**Author:** Omar Khattab (@lateinteraction)
**Date:** January 23, 2026

Khattab discusses the evolving distinction between LLM agents and workflows, arguing that "the distinction between LLM 'agents' and 'workflows' was always murky and is slowly blurring." He identifies three key differences that are converging:

## 1. State Management

Agents accumulate context in prompts as history, while workflows manage state in code variables. RLMs represent a middle ground by maintaining all context while allowing selective access.

## 2. Instruction Delivery

Traditional agents use fixed prompt instructions regardless of state, whereas workflows adapt prompts to different situations. Replit's Decision-Time Guidance and Agent Skills allow dynamic instruction pulling within a cohesive agent framework.

## 3. Control Flow

Agents typically let LLMs dictate control flow, which limits scalability. RLMs enable models to symbolically write recursive programs and audit outputs for revisions.

## Context

The tweet quotes a preceding post by Zhen Li about "Decision-Time Guidance in @Replit Agent" and how it "moves beyond front-loaded rules and repeated reminders."
