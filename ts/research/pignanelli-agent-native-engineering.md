# Agent-Native Engineering

**Author:** Andrew Pignanelli
**Date:** February 5, 2026

## Overview

Pignanelli outlines a new organizational paradigm where AI coding agents function as primary individual contributors rather than supporting tools for engineers. The core concept involves restructuring teams around asynchronous agent workflows alongside synchronous engineer work.

## Three Task Levels

The framework categorizes work as:
- **Simple:** Single-pass agent tasks, done almost instantly
- **Manageable:** Iterative agent work, done daily
- **Complex:** Engineer-led with agent support, dominates engineer attention

As he notes, "Simple tasks are done almost instantly, manageable tasks are done daily" while complex work dominates engineer attention.

## Organizational Shifts

Engineers transition toward management and product thinking roles. Managers become staff engineers. The author emphasizes eliminating dual code-review requirements as bottlenecks preventing engineers from shipping "dozens of PRs a day."

## Quality Control

Code quality depends on comprehensive rulesets, test suites, and linters rather than human review. The General Intelligence Company reportedly maintains separate rule sets for frontend, backend, architecture, and style guidelines.

## Resource Investment

The author discloses spending approximately $4,000 monthly per engineer on AI tokens -- roughly matching engineer salary percentages -- justified by 3-4x output increases and 20+ daily PR shipments.

## Future Vision

Pignanelli predicts IDEs and human code review become obsolete by 2026's conclusion, with engineers evolving into product managers and design becoming increasingly critical to competitive advantage.
