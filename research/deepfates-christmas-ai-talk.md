# How to Talk to Your Family About AI

**Published:** Dec 25, 2025

The author describes AI systems as uniquely human-like entities trained on our culture that "learn how to think, not like computers...but like us." Large language models represent humanity compressing its collective knowledge into accessible tools available to anyone.

The piece frames AI adoption as democratizing technology with significant global implications. "A lot of the research just involves asking them questions a bunch of times!" the author notes, suggesting experimentation over passive fear.

The author advocates for hands-on engagement: "If you're an artist, have it figure out the business crap. If you're a director, try it for storyboarding." Direct interaction is presented as more valuable than abstract concerns.

## Key Claims Addressed

The article dismisses several common concerns as unfounded:

- Water usage concerns are "fake" while energy consumption remains genuine
- Synthetic data and data poisoning narratives lack merit
- Most AI detectors are unreliable
- Copyright debates primarily benefit large corporations

The author argues that waiting for market corrections or legal challenges represents counterproductive thinking. Instead, the overarching message emphasizes: "TRY IT AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF"

The piece concludes that understanding AI requires personal experimentation rather than relying on secondhand narratives or speculation about unknown technology.
