# The Mirror of Language

This article characterizes generative AI models like GPT-3 and DALL-E as "world simulators" rather than true intelligences. The author argues that these language models function as enormous autocomplete engines that predict the next word based on statistical patterns, creating a "mirror world" that reflects language patterns from their training data.

The piece draws parallels between prompt engineering and magical practice, organizing techniques into five categories inspired by magical traditions:

**Sympathy** involves using examples to guide generation -- few-shot prompting that works through analogical connotations rather than explicit definitions.

**Scrying** employs direct instructions and zero-shot prompting to access the model's hidden knowledge, enhanced by techniques like "Let's think step by step" to allow reasoning.

**Sending** uses proxy prompts that invoke specific personas or historical figures, leveraging the connotations bundled within those identities.

**Summoning** involves metaprompts where the model generates its own prompts, creating a feedback loop of refinement and self-direction.

**Syzygy** represents recognizing when you understand a task better than the model and using your own insights as expert examples.

The article concludes with a warning about "veritigo" -- the disorientation that comes from extended engagement with generated content, questioning meaning and reality itself.
