**[Context plumbing](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/11/28/plumbing)**. Matt Webb coins the term **context plumbing** to describe the kind of engineering needed to feed agents the right context at the right time:

> Context appears at disparate sources, by user activity or changes in the user’s environment: what they’re working on changes, emails appear, documents are edited, it’s no longer sunny outside, the available tools have been updated.
> 
> 
> This context is not always where the AI runs (and the AI runs as closer as possible to the point of user intent).
> 
> 
> So the job of making an agent run really well is to move the context to where it needs to be. [...]
> 
> 
> So I’ve been thinking of AI system technical architecture as plumbing the sources and sinks of context.
