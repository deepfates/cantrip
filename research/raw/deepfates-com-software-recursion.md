Markdown Content:
We no longer have to write the software by hand. We write the test that we expect to pass and the computer generates. Well actually we don’t write the test by hand. We write the spec and the computer generates the tests from that. Well actually we don’t write the spec by hand. We write the design brief and the computer generates the spec based on the constraints. Well actually we don’t write the design brief by hand, we just figure out what the next feature should be and the computer generates the brief. Well actually we don’t figure out what the next feature should be manually, we observe desire paths from the users and the computer generates the feature request. Well actually the computer observes the users and detects their desire paths. Well actually the user is also a computer. Well actually the the computer is detecting the desire paths of the computer and building the software for the computer. Well actually we’re not sure where the software is, we can’t see it being built anymore. We can just tell because the machines are all working really really hard.
