This needs to be normalized before the v7 beta release, especially in preparation for renaming `providerOptions` to `options`. ## Summary Normalizes all provider-specific model options type names across 31 packages to follow a consistent `*ModelOptions` convention and ensures they are all exported: - Renamed types to follow `{Provider}{ModelType}{OptionalModelSuffix}Options` pattern, e.g.: - `AnthropicProviderOptions` → `AnthropicLanguageModelOptions` - `OpenAIResponsesProviderOptions` → `OpenAILanguageModelResponsesOptions` - Renamed Zod schemas to match - e.g. `anthropicProviderOptions` → `anthropicLanguageModelOptions` - Exported 13 types from 8 packages that were previously internal-only, e.g. - `GroqTranscriptionModelOptions` - `OpenAITranscriptionModelOptions` - `FalSpeechModelOptions` - Added deprecated aliases for all previously exported names across 23 packages to maintain backward compatibility - Fixed `@ai-sdk/groq`: Already had a transcription model options type, but in the wrong file and under the wrong name and not exported - Updated ~190 example files to use `satisfies *Options` on `providerOptions` inner objects - Updates examples across documentation to use the new type names and include the types on examples where they were missing but relevant - Added the new naming convention and export requirements to `contributing/providers.md` All changes are fully backward compatible — no breaking changes. ## Manual Verification - `pnpm type-check:full` passes with no errors - `pnpm build` succeeds for all packages - `pnpm prettier-check` passes ## Checklist - [x] Tests have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features) - [x] Documentation has been added / updated (for bug fixes / features) - [x] A _patch_ changeset for relevant packages has been added (for bug fixes / features - run `pnpm changeset` in the project root) - [x] I have reviewed this pull request (self-review) ## Future Work Consider adding options types for providers that don't have them yet, and add `satisfies` to those examples accordingly.

AI SDK
======

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#ai-sdk)

The [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs) is a provider-agnostic TypeScript toolkit designed to help you build AI-powered applications and agents using popular UI frameworks like Next.js, React, Svelte, Vue, Angular, and runtimes like Node.js.

To learn more about how to use the AI SDK, check out our [API Reference](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference) and [Documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs).

Installation
------------

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#installation)

You will need Node.js 18+ and npm (or another package manager) installed on your local development machine.

undefinedshell
npm install ai
undefined

Skill for Coding Agents
-----------------------

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#skill-for-coding-agents)

If you use coding agents such as Claude Code or Cursor, we highly recommend adding the AI SDK skill to your repository:

undefinedshell
npx skills add vercel/ai
undefined

Unified Provider Architecture
-----------------------------

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#unified-provider-architecture)

The AI SDK provides a [unified API](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/providers-and-models) to interact with model providers like [OpenAI](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai), [Anthropic](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic), [Google](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai), and [more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers).

By default, the AI SDK uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to give you access to all major providers out of the box. Just pass a model string for any supported model:

undefinedts
const result = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4.5', // or 'openai/gpt-5.2', 'google/gemini-3-flash', etc.
  prompt: 'Hello!',
});
undefined

You can also connect to providers directly using their SDK packages:

undefinedshell
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic @ai-sdk/google
undefined

undefinedts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

const result = await generateText({
  model: anthropic('claude-opus-4-5-20250414'), // or openai('gpt-5.2'), google('gemini-3-flash'), etc.
  prompt: 'Hello!',
});
undefined

Usage
-----

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#usage)

### Generating Text

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#generating-text)

undefinedts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5', // use Vercel AI Gateway
  prompt: 'What is an agent?',
});
undefined

undefinedts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'), // use OpenAI Responses API
  prompt: 'What is an agent?',
});
undefined

### Generating Structured Data

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#generating-structured-data)

undefinedts
import { generateText, Output } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { output } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      recipe: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        ingredients: z.array(
          z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() }),
        ),
        steps: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
undefined

### Agents

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#agents)

undefinedts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';

const sandboxAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  system: 'You are an agent with access to a shell environment.',
  tools: {
    shell: openai.tools.localShell({
      execute: async ({ action }) => {
        const [cmd, ...args] = action.command;
        const sandbox = await getSandbox(); // Vercel Sandbox
        const command = await sandbox.runCommand({ cmd, args });
        return { output: await command.stdout() };
      },
    }),
  },
});
undefined

### UI Integration

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#ui-integration)

The [AI SDK UI](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) module provides a set of hooks that help you build chatbots and generative user interfaces. These hooks are framework agnostic, so they can be used in Next.js, React, Svelte, and Vue.

You need to install the package for your framework, e.g.:

undefinedshell
npm install @ai-sdk/react
undefined

#### Agent @/agent/image-generation-agent.ts

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#agent-agentimage-generation-agentts)

export const imageGenerationAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  tools: {
    generateImage: openai.tools.imageGeneration({
      partialImages: 3,
    }),
  },
});

export type ImageGenerationAgentMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<
  typeof imageGenerationAgent
>;
undefined

import { createAgentUIStreamResponse } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  return createAgentUIStreamResponse({
    agent: imageGenerationAgent,
    messages,
  });
}

import { UIToolInvocation } from 'ai';

export default function ImageGenerationView({
  invocation,
}: {
  invocation: UIToolInvocation<ReturnType<typeof openai.tools.imageGeneration>>;
}) {
  switch (invocation.state) {
    case 'input-available':
      return <div>Generating image...</div>;
    case 'output-available':
      return <img src={`data:image/png;base64,${invocation.output.result}`} />;
  }
}
undefined

#### Page @/app/page.tsx

[](https://github.com/vercel/ai#page-apppagetsx)

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, status, sendMessage } =
    useChat<ImageGenerationAgentMessage>();

  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const handleSubmit = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    sendMessage({ text: input });
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map(message => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          <strong>{`${message.role}: `}</strong>
          {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>;
              case 'tool-generateImage':
                return <ImageGenerationView key={index} invocation={part} />;
            }
          })}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)}
          disabled={status !== 'ready'}
