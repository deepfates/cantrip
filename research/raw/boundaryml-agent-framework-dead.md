Overview
--------

We propose that the popular notions of of “Agent” and “Tool Call” live at a particularly confusing point within in a larger design space. Reframing “Agent” and “Tool” as a “Programmer” and “Program Fragment” can clarify the architecture of Agentic AI systems and suggest more powerful agentic programming models.

Prelude: Lambda the Ultimate
----------------------------

In the 1970’s and 80’s Gerald Sussman and Guy Steele wrote a number of academic papers to illustrate how lambda calculus - a universal model for computation, could be extended to get straight to the heart of previously messy concepts like subroutines, side-effects, declarative programming, and logic programming.

These papers had titles like [Lambda the Ultimate Imperative](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5790) and [Lambda the Ultimate GOTO](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/383/havens/pubs/lambda-the-ultimate-goto.pdf), establishing the “Lambda the Ultimate” moniker for research into the “ultimate” (discovered, rather than invented) mathematical structure of previously invented techniques. Today, papers like [Lambda the Ultimate Backpropagator](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~qobi/papers/toplas2008.pdf) and [LURK: Lambda the Ultimate Recursive Knowledge](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/369) adopt this tradition to explain and enrich the programming models for things like machine learning and programming with zero-knowledge proofs.

The Tedious Nature of Tool Calling
----------------------------------

Many people building their first agentic applications find the concepts of tool calling and “the while loop” confusing. The app structure is like this:

*   App developer specifies a list of tools, their parameters and possibly their return types.
*   App developer develops an LLM prompt for choosing a tool based on the current app state.
*   Client code runs “the while loop” - a loop that makes LLM requests to determine the next tool call to make, interprets the tool and runs it, then appends both the tool call and its result to a log of the past tool calls. The Tool-choosing LLM is then called again with a context augmented by the previous tool result. This loop continues until the LLM declares that no more tool calls are required.

With this recipe, an LLM and a client are able to carry out multi-step, open-ended tasks on behalf of the user.

The confusing aspects of this model come when we compare it to regular programming. We are accustomed to making a number of function calls one after the other to accumulate the data needed to build up a return value, the Agentic loop forces the app developer to (A) break functions out into a number of tools, and to write a prompt instructing an LLM how to choose a tool, then (B) write a while loop in the LLM client runs the LLM's chosen tools and updates context for subsequent calls to the same LLM function.

![Image 3: A diagram showing the interaction between client and Agent](https://boundaryml.com/_next/image?url=%2Fblog%2F2025-05-20-lambda-the-ultimate-ai-agent%2Fwhile-loop.png&w=1200&q=75)

Reframing: Agents are Programmers, Tools are Program Fragments
--------------------------------------------------------------

Our hypothetical developer, trying to make sense of the Agentic development cycle, may notice that the Tools available to the LLM are similar to Remote Procedure Calls. In RPC systems, procedures are “defunctionalized” by converting them into names, so that the names can be transmitted to some remote server, used to look up the function implementation, and executed. The main difference between RPC Calls and Tool Calls is that a developer selects RPC calls within a larger function, while an Agent selects Tools within a larger Agentic loop.

Another difference is that RPCs have typed return values, and as developers issuing RPC calls, we can chain multiple RPC calls together when the outputs of one match the inputs of the next. When issuing a series of Tool calls in a loop, there is no such chaining. Instead we have an append-only log of Tool calls and tool results.

Finally, the developer orchestrating the “while loop” and appending `(tool call, tool result)` pairs to a list, feels dissatisfied that they are somehow writing a strange type of boilerplate code. Returning to the RPC analogy, the application developer is writing a little bit of the RPC framework itself, right next to the business logic of their application.

If Tool calls are like RPC calls, then the agent issuing the tool calls becomes a programmer issuing RPC calls. The language runtime becomes the Agentic client while loop, and the variable binding context becomes the history of the LLM context.

| **Programming** | **Agentic System** |
| --- | --- |
| RPC Call | Tool call |
| Programmer | Agent |
| Runtime | While loop |
| Variables | Context stack |

There are several issues related to this analogy. The while loop is not a _good_ runtime. The context stack is not a _good_ binding environment. Tool calls are not as flexible or composable as general function calls. In the Agentic System, there is nothing analogous to function definition, and no straightforward way to compose functions.

**Are these deficiencies in the analogy? Or is the analogy fine, and the deficiency lies in the Agentic model?**

Tip

**Greenspun’s Tenth Rule** Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

Perhaps Greenspun is right, LLM prodivers have become sufficiently complicated Fortran programs and Agent Frameworks are our accidental Common Lisp implementation.

Giving Agents Better Programming Tools
--------------------------------------

To resolve the awkward edges of writing Agents, we can embrace the model of Agent as Programmer, and augment the 1-step tools with compound Tools that can be used to compose other Tools into larger fragments.

**In other words - Agents can only do one thing at a time - but what if they could write and run whole programs?**

The app developer’s existing tools may look something like this:

*   `getWeather: Location -> WeatherReport` Get the weather at some location.
*   `getTime: () -> DateTime` Get the current time.
*   `fetchSimilarDocuments: Query -> String[]` Fetch relevant documents from a vector database.
*   `getAvailability: Name -> DateTime[]` List the upcoming calendar availability of a specific user.
*   `scheduleMeeting: Name -> DateTime -> ()` Book a time on the user’s calendar.
*   `sendFinalMessage: String -> ()` Send a message to the UI and signal to the client that the Agentic action is complete.

The additional tools needed to compose other Tools together could look like this:

*   `sequence: ([Tools, .., ToolA]) -> A` Carry out the action of one a sequence of tools, returning the final Tool’s result.
*   `forEach: (A[], (A -> ToolB)) -> B[]` Given a list of `A` values and a tool that turns an `A` into a `B`, return a list of `B` values.
*   `callBuiltin: ((A -> B), A) -> B` Apply a builtin function to an argument.
*   `assignVariable: (Name, A) -> ()` Assign a value to a variable for later use.

Since the key feature of an Agentic AI system is that it can handle queries requiring flexibility beyond what can be hard-coded by the human designer, it is natural that the human designer should be able to specify the agent’s capabilities in smaller chunks, and to allow the AI to specify how those chunks should be composed.

The current Agentic AI paradigm does allow tool composition, but only in an unnatural way. The agentic framework and the agent have an implicit contract that each RPC call will result in some data that will be appended to the context, and that full history will be written into the context and fed back to the LLM, which produces a new single tool call.

In our updated understanding of the _agent as a programmer_, this is analogous to writing one line of a program, executing that, getting the data (along with the original goal specification), and writing one line of a new program to compute the next step. The programmer has somewhat grotesquely been sucked in among the computer’s whirling gears, and the programming process is directly interleaved with the hot loop of the interpreter. Our proposal, obvious from this perspective, is to remove the programmer from the hot loop, by allowing it to write programs that can run more than a single line at a time.

### But Are the Models Smart Enough?

One potential issue with our proposal is that we are giving the LLM more expressive power and simultaneously demanding more from its reasoning and structured outputs. Is there “anyone home” to make use of that extra expressive ability, or are we just giving mice a better graphing calculator?

Let’s do a quick experiment to see if models are able to express their programming intent as a structured higher-order tool call.

GeneratePlan

PlanMeeting3Way

system

Generate a plan for the following query: Find a common time for Greg, Bob and Alice to meet
A plan is a small program.
You have let bindings ("bind")
and you can call tools and builtin functions.

When you produce a list of tool calls, they will be run
in sequence.

There is a standard library of builtin functions:
 - intersection (returns the intersection of two lists)
 - head (returns the first element of a list)
 - tail (returns the list without the first element)

For example, to book a common meeting time, you might
bind the two availabilities to two variables, bind
the intersection to a variable, and then sequnce
booking the head of that list of times on each
of the two people's calendars.

Start by writing the plan in pseudocode.

Finally, after writing the pseudocode, translate
to this schema:

Bind {
  type: "bind",
  variable_name: string,
  body: {
    type: "get_availability",
    user: string,
    return_type: "Date[]",
  } or {
    type: "book_appointment",
    user: string,
    datetime: string,
    return_type: "unit",
  } or {
    type: "builtin_function",
    function_name: string,
    argument_variables: string[],
    return_type: string[],
  } or Bind,
  return_type: string,
}

Answer with a JSON Array using this schema:
[
  {
    type: "get_availability",
    user: string,
    return_type: "Date[]",
  } or {
    type: "book_appointment",
    user: string,
    datetime: string,
    return_type: "unit",
  } or {
    type: "builtin_function",
    function_name: string,
    argument_variables: string[],
    return_type: string[],
  } or Bind
]

No tests running

In this example, we have defined tools that can refer to the results of previous tools, allowing the model to express a multi-step solution to the query. Our prompt gave a hint for solving a two-way calendar scheduling task. Our test asks the same agent to schedule a meeting between three people, and the agent generalizes to produce a new, valid solution.

We could write the tool handler to interpret these tool calls that would carry out the steps without needing to issue a new LLM call to interpret the data received at each step. Perhaps unsurprisingly, modern LLMs have the capacity to compose multi-step workflows.

To test the limits of the generality of those abilities, try tweaking the prompt and tool calls.

We still need benchmarks to measure the quality of full-program Tool generation, but there is another reason to be hopeful that this approach is more effective than the RPC-style status quo: Neville et. al. (2025) showed that [LLMs Get Lost in Multi-Turn Conversation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06120). 1-step RPC-style tools that append to the context are multi-turn conversations.

Manifesting Lambda, the Ultimate AI Agent
-----------------------------------------

The analogy of an AI Agent as a developer is a definition. Definitions are not right or wrong, but they can be helpful if they guide our thinking in productive directions, or unhelpful if they lead us astray. Here are the most important consequences we derive from this definition:

*   **Better DSL**: Current tool-calling approaches provide an inadequate programming model for the Agent, consisting of single-step RPC calls and the assumption that the Agent will be called subsequently with an updated state, from which it will make a new call. Nothing but the call history provides coherence to the agent’s plan. We should aide the Agent by giving it a better programming model.
*   **No Programmer in the Loop**: Compositional tool plans allow the agent’s plan to execute without having to call back into the Agent at every step.
*   **Iterative tooling**: We don’t expect human coders to produce valid programs on the first try. We should provide linting and type-checking capabilities that allow Agents to compose plans iteratively.

This article has presented the analogy of the Agent as a programmer, rather than the Agent as a program, and attempted to justify it by using it to design a better programming model for tool use. Our main goal is not to advocate for this particular proposal, but to stimulate a broader discussion: what is the most effective DX (developer experience) for AI, how can we build it, and how much latent ability of the LLM can this unlock? We will explore ideas around AIX (Developer Experience for AIs) in a future post.
