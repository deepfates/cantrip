## Summary

This article presents a personal critique of contemporary software design patterns and philosophical approaches. The author argues against several prevailing design conventions, framing them as lazy decisions rather than thoughtful choices.

## Key Critiques

**Indirection Problems**
The author dislikes how hyperlinks provide no context about their destination, and opposes footnotes that force navigation away from text. They favor margin notes and link previews instead.

**Transclusion Issues**
The author rejects automatically synced content across multiple locations, arguing that "facts are temporal" and documents should reflect information as it existed at a specific time. They prefer manual copying for robustness.

**Ideological Design Mistakes**
- **Liquid glass aesthetics**: Excessive padding and transparency waste screen space on desktops
- **Poor data-ink ratios**: Argues for useful pixels over decorative elements
- **Personal software obsession**: Criticizes the trend toward insular, private knowledge systems, advocating instead for public, shareable work

**Lazy Patterns**
The author opposes several widespread but unexamined conventions:
- "Above the fold" landing page dogma
- Infinite canvases requiring endless organization
- Modals that block interaction
- Bento box layouts that lack narrative structure
- Fuzzy search yielding unclear results

## Notable Perspective

The author emphasizes that design decisions should emerge from observing actual usage patterns rather than ideological commitments or industry conventions. They advocate for clarity, user control, and intentional prioritization over automating away user agency.
