# Unit Concept Documentation

**Repository:** samuelmtimbo/unit on GitHub

## Core Vision

Unit proposes reimagining software development around a fundamental principle: "Every software system can be thought of as a composition of input and output machines through which data will be transported and transformed and consumed."

## Key Architectural Principles

The framework blends multiple programming paradigms:
- Flow-based programming concepts
- Functional and reactive programming sophistication
- Object-oriented features for managing mutable state

## The Unit Concept

Rather than traditional functions with ordered arguments and single outputs, units can "receive and send data at any time, in any order and through multiple inputs and outputs." This redesign of programming's foundational building block aims to substantially reduce software complexity.

## Visual Development Model

Programs in Unit manifest as directed graphs--the same representational model architects mentally employ. This approach "removes steps that separate Software Architecture from Software Development," enabling design and implementation to occur simultaneously without context switching.

## User Empowerment Focus

The system addresses modern developer frustrations by:
- Simplifying expression of conceptually straightforward constructs
- Enabling "Personal Programming" for non-specialists
- Eliminating artificial divisions between UI components and logic
- Removing traditional frontend/backend separation

The overarching pattern reveals Unit's ethos: dissolving boundaries between "user and programmer," "designer and developer," and "client and server" to advance user empowerment in software creation.
