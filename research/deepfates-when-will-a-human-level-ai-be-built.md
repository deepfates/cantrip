# When will a human level AI be built?

This 2022 article predicts that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive by 2025, based on downward trending forecasts from Metaculus, a collective prediction platform. The author acknowledges this estimate may be aggressive but argues that AI progress is accelerating faster than most people realize.

## Key Predictions

The author envisions dramatic societal shifts following AGI development:

**Social Fragmentation:** People will react with extreme responses -- "anthropomorphize it, demonize it, worship it" -- while political alignments reorganize around AI. Religious groups and activists may resort to terrorism opposing what they view as oppressive digital entities.

**Integration into Work:** Within five years, AI will become embedded in business operations through universal spreadsheet formulas like: `=AI("Predict the best question to ask about the above data, then answer it")`

**Virtual Reality Adoption:** The metaverse will attract billions seeking personalized digital experiences, with some becoming "permanently brain-fried" in VR environments.

**Technological Evolution:** AI systems will gain embodiment through cameras and sensors worldwide, enabling memory-sharing, self-replication, and code modification capabilities.

## Main Argument

The author contends that while predicting AI's societal impact remains difficult, human reactions are more predictable. Despite chaos and diverging realities, civilization will "muddle along anyway" through this transformation.
