# Building Internal Agents

**Author:** Will Larson
**Published:** January 1, 2026

## Overview

Will Larson documents Imprint's approach to developing internal agent workflows, describing this as organizational capability-building rather than core product work. The piece introduces a nine-part series exploring practical challenges in agent development.

## Key Topics Covered

The article outlines a series on agent development challenges including:
- Skill support
- File handling
- Context management
- Evaluation
- Logging
- Subagents
- Workflow coordination
- Triggers
- Iterative refinement

## Learning Pathway Recommended

Larson suggests aspiring agent builders should:

1. Study LLM fundamentals through resources like _AI Engineering_ by Chip Huyen
2. Build a basic LLM script
3. Incrementally add tool-calling capabilities
4. Implement tool search functionality
5. Create virtual file systems
6. Support agent skills
7. Add evaluation systems
8. Address context window limitations

## On Existing Frameworks

The author characterizes established frameworks as "fairly thin wrappers" and recommends building custom implementations for learning purposes, though acknowledges existing frameworks like OpenAI's and Claude's SDKs as viable long-term options.

## Core Recommendation

Larson advocates that "every company should be doing this work internally" as relatively low-risk investment in emerging AI capabilities.
