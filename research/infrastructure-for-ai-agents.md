## Abstract

The paper proposes the concept of agent infrastructure -- technical systems and shared protocols external to agents designed to mediate their interactions with environments. The authors argue that as AI agents become more sophisticated and autonomous, direct behavioral modifications alone are insufficient. Instead, external infrastructure will be essential for managing heterogeneous agent interactions.

The research identifies three core functions for agent infrastructure:

1. **Attribution**: Assigning actions, properties, and information to specific agents, users, or other actors
2. **Interaction Shaping**: Structuring how agents communicate and form agreements with each other
3. **Harm Detection and Remediation**: Identifying and addressing harmful agent actions

The authors compare this framework to internet infrastructure like HTTPS, suggesting agent infrastructure will become equally indispensable. They provide an incomplete catalog of research directions, analyzing use cases, adoption challenges, relationships to existing internet infrastructure, limitations, and outstanding questions.
