## Overview

Pollen is a publishing system designed to help authors create functional and beautiful digital books. Created by Matthew Butterick, it powers his acclaimed works including *Practical Typography*, *Typography for Lawyers*, and *Beautiful Racket*.

## Core Philosophy

The system rests on three fundamental premises:

1. Digital books should represent the pinnacle of what publishing can achieve, yet currently fall short of their potential.

2. Since digital books function as software, authors must reconceptualize books as executable programs rather than static data.

3. Improving digital books requires leveraging their inherent programmability.

## Key Features

**Markup-Based Authoring:** Writers can compose and edit content naturally using Pollen's markup language without requiring programming expertise.

**Programming Integration:** When automation, cross-referencing, or data integration becomes necessary, users access Racket -- a complete programming language embedded within the text environment.

**Racket Foundation:** Butterick selected Racket specifically for unique capabilities that enabled Pollen's design and functionality.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation comprises 18 main sections, progressing from installation through advanced programming concepts:

- Installation and quick-start guidance
- Four comprehensive tutorials covering preprocessors, templates, and markup
- Mini-tutorials for syntax highlighting and mathematics
- Command-line tools reference
- Complete module and function references
- Acknowledgments and licensing information

The materials emphasize practical application while maintaining accessibility for users without programming backgrounds.
