# Magic Crystals

**Published:** November 25, 2024

Noah Smith's recent commentary illustrates a widespread misconception about artificial intelligence's current limitations. According to the article, "The world is made of data and we have put sensors all over it," yet data scarcity isn't the genuine bottleneck constraining AI development.

The author identifies the actual challenges as computational and infrastructural rather than informational. Training advanced models demands enormous processing power sustained over extended periods -- weeks or months of continuous GPU operation. This requires substantial financial investment and access to specialized hardware, creating a competitive landscape where resources remain perpetually scarce.

The piece highlights three interconnected constraints:

## Resource Limitations

"There are only so many investors" and limited GPU availability creates perpetual competition for these critical components.

## Training Risks

Even with sufficient computing resources and electricity, complex training runs carry mysterious failure risks, making large-scale experiments inherently speculative.

## Deployment Challenges

Once successfully trained, powerful AI systems present control and verification difficulties. The author questions how organizations can reliably ensure models behave appropriately and generate value safely.

The economic dimension proves equally critical -- running trained models incurs substantial operational costs. Converting these capabilities into profitable applications while maintaining investor confidence requires demonstrating both safety and commercial viability simultaneously.
