# Dismantling Invocations

The practice termed "unbundling" functions as a type of metaprompt, converting a direct instruction into an indirect summoning technique.

## Core Concept

Unbundling involves deconstructing a specific artistic reference -- such as "Van Gogh starry night" -- into its constituent elements: aesthetic qualities, emotional resonance, and material characteristics. Rather than invoking the original by name, this approach calls upon those qualities through their descriptive components.

## Practical Applications

The author employs language models to articulate concepts prevalent in current discourse, breaking down recognizable styles into their underlying attributes. This mirrors the magical practice of calling upon archetypal energies without naming them directly -- summoning "the messenger, the merchant, the trickster" rather than speaking a deity's true name.

## Vector Composition

An intriguing extension involves extracting embeddings of these deconstructed concepts and integrating them into prompt vectors. Many existing systems already facilitate this through the pipe operator ("|"), which weights and combines multiple prompts.

The piece raises compelling questions: Can these vectors be composed functionally? Might they generate novel scenes through systematic combination? Could this approach enable a sophisticated iterative process of stylistic translation?

## Inverse Operations

A proposed refinement would reverse the model's standard operation: providing multiple artworks and receiving descriptive text that captures their shared characteristics -- text that, when fed back as a prompt, recreates that unified aesthetic.
