# Do You Visit the Library

Do you visit the Library in your dreams? Did you know other people access it as well?

I had a job there once.

For like 6 months I worked every night at the library, in a small study, custom designing sigils for people's needs.

They would slip a wish under my door and I would design a sigil and slip it back, never seeing my client. So that I could not interfere.
