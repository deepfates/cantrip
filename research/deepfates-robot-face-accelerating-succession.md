# Accelerating Succession

_Originally published on [Robot Face](https://robotface.substack.com/p/accelerating-succession)._

## Previously

The author introduced _algorithm gardening_ -- managing software in an ecological manner. Computers exist within interconnected webs rather than in isolation, much like plants. This interconnection extends to humans, whose minds are linked through electronic communication. The concept suggests we should tend to algorithms as we would gardens: building soil, growing food, and encouraging wildlife.

## What is Ecological Succession?

Ecological succession describes nature's transformation of barren landscape into mature forest. Life progressively creates conditions enabling additional life. The process follows a recognizable pattern:

Retreating glaciers expose bare rock. Lichen colonizes and breaks down rock, creating soil. Grasses, herbs, and shrubs establish roots. Pioneer trees penetrate deeper soil, facilitating water absorption. Fast-growing trees accumulate leaf litter, enriching soil. Finally, dominant trees form a closed canopy, stabilizing the environment to their preferences -- "The trees garden the forest for the trees."

## Implications for Humans

Mature forests offer limited sustenance for people. The dense canopy suppresses undergrowth, restricting food sources to scattered berries, nuts, and mushrooms. Hunting becomes necessary, requiring extensive territory per person.

The most productive ecosystem for human needs is the _immature_ forest, featuring multiple vertical plant layers. "The key to ecological gardening is to accelerate succession, replacing non-food plants with food plants" while maintaining this intermediate stage through harvesting and pruning.

## Computers and Planetary Balance

Computers require climate stability similar to human and plant needs. Current environmental destabilization through runaway warming threatens all species. Rather than reinventing solutions, humans should leverage plant photosynthesis for carbon capture and establish symbiotic relationships with computers through observation and interaction.

## Human-Computer Evolution

Developer interfaces reveal evolving human-computer relationships:

- **Command line**: One-way stilted conversation requiring extensive user attention
- **Scripts**: More complex thought, recipe-like instructions for sequential execution
- **Packages**: Social programming through code reuse and dependency ecosystems
- **IDE**: Integrated development combining editing and package management
- **Notebooks**: Two-way conversation allowing code, text, and multimedia integration

Notebooks represent revolutionary progress. Tools like `nbdev` enable humans to think creatively and intuit patterns while computers execute calculations and display information. "The interaction is symbiotic. It begins to feel like gardening."

Human-computer collaboration becomes most effective when each performs its strengths: human creativity paired with computational precision.
